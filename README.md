# (WIP) Reinforcement-Learning in JS ðŸ¤– 

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ¤—, so basically, the goal of this repo is to act as a learning companion as you go through the standard RL text: [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2020.pdf)

<!-- Each algorithm has its own README explaining the intuition behind that algorithm along with an example app.js implementing one of the exercise's solution. -->

All code is written in Javascript and uses environments from an OpenAI gym like library written just for this Repo.(see, ðŸ“‚ Environments ) for function approximators we used [tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/)

ðŸ—’: Note that this project is meant to be used for learning and researching purposes only and **it is not meant to be used for production.**


## List of Algorithms:

* Monte-Carlo


## Setup:

**Install all dependencies**
```
npm install
```

**Build the project**
```
